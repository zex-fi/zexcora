## Dependencies
1. install `MCL` required for fastecdsa ([follow instructions](https://github.com/herumi/mcl?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build-with-cmake))

In order to test the backend follow these steps:
1. run server: `TEST_MODE=1 python app/main.py`
2. use a websocket client like [https://hoppscotch.io/realtime/websocket](https://hoppscotch.io/realtime/websocket)
   1. connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ws`
   2. send the following as json body to subscribe to events: 
    ```json
    {
        "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
        "params":
            [
                "BTC-USDT@kline_1m",
                "BTC-USDT@depth"
            ],
        "id": 1
    }
      ```
3. the data for each of the subscribed channels listed inside `params` will be sent as a json string according to binance websocket API
4. to stop receiving data from a channel modify the method to `UNSUBSCRIBE`
